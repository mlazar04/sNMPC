# sNMPC
Matlab toolbox for computing terminal costs and sets for stabilizing nonlinear MPC.

The toolbox consists of a set of Matlab functions, which are described in the PDF sNMPC Toolbox User Manual.

Installation simply requires copying the files on your computer and adding the folder to the path. 

However, several other toolboxes have to be installed as detailed in the User Manual.

Several example files are provided which can be edited by the user to define your own example/settings.
